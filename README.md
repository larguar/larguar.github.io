# Portfolio Website
It’s hard enough to keep up with updating a portfolio website when it’s built in a content management system, so it’s no surprise my past Github-based portfolios haven’t been updated as frequently as they should’ve been. My goal for my new site was to make adding new work as quick and low-maintenance as possible so I could do it more often.

Utilizing the Behance API, I was able to automatically pull my projects from Behance. As a designer, since I’m expected to update both my website and Behance regularly, this was the most efficient route for me to take. Now, when I make any updates on Behance – whether I’m adding a new project or reordering existing ones – my portfolio site automatically reflects those changes.

To make my website uniquely mine, I sprinkled in some personality with randomly generated fun facts about me, accompanying GIFs, and a logo that rotates on page scroll.
