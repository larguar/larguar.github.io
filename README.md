# Portfolio Website
It’s hard enough to keep up with updating a portfolio website when it’s built in a content management system, so it’s no surprise my past Github-based portfolios haven’t been updated as frequently as they should’ve been. My goal for my new site was to make adding new work as easy and efficient as possible so I could do it more often. Utilizing the Behance API, I was able to automatically pull my projects from my Behance Portfolio. As a designer, I’m expected to update both my portfolio website and my Behance portfolio regularly, so I decided this was the most efficient route to take. Now, when I make any updates on my Behance portfolio – whether I’m adding a new project or reordering existing projects – my portfolio site automatically updates with those changes.
